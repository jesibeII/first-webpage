<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an avid fanfiction writer and lover. I can devour a fic in lickety split. No fic is safe from my watchful eyes.</p>

<p>On top of that, I have recently been learning <h4>Web Development.</h4> OOOOOH so shiny and cool of me, I know. Please, hold your applause.</p>

<p>I think Web Development is pretty cool so far and I am enjoying the course I have been taking. I would no doubt recommend this course to someone who is interested.</p>
